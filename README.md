# Contest Free TON ICU

See it in action contest.freeton.icu

## Introduction

This project is meant to serve two main goals: The first being it is fully styled, responsive, generic website to use as a starting point for your own Apostrophe development. The second being a demonstration of a fully featured production-ready Apostrophe build: a host of widgets (both simple and complex), networks of related content (pieces), custom content taxonomy, importing pieces, maps, advanced Apostrophe configuration, etc. all while organizing code the way we, the ApostropheCMS maintainers, do in production.

## Getting Started

You need to [set up your environment](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html) with the necessities to develop with Apostrophe.

Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tesla-hash/freeton_contest
cd freeton_contest
npm install
node app apostrophe-users:add admin admin
[enter password when prompted]
node app
```

You should now be able to access the site at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and log in to start editing by visiting [/login](http://localhost:3000/login).
